# @byungi/npi

> npm pack and install a remote package

Sometimes, some packages can't be installed on CI/CD. Installing these packages as a tarball file can be an alternative. `npi` reduces the repetition of pack and install commands.

## Usage

```sh
# global install
npm i @byungi/npi -g

# run script
npi react@^17 react-dom@^17
```
